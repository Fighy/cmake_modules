# Provides the necessary logic to use the same toolchain that also built OpenCMISS.
# This module is intended to be included BEFORE any project calls, as those fix the compilers
# and a later change is not possible anymore.
#
# To import the OpenCMISS configuration and libraries, use find_package(OpenCMISS).
